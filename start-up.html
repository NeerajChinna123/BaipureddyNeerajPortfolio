          <h1>RETECH</h1>
          <h2>Problem</h2>
          <p>
            Generally, people get mobile repairs and it would be difficult for students to get it repaired who manage their needs with their pocket money like some times the repair cost will be half the price of the mobile phone and even for the middle-class people it would be difficult to get their mobile phones repaired, even though in black markets if you fix your mobile phone at low cost, they won't give a warranty and they use duplicate parts in the repairs. So you may get mobile repairs again like the black markets provide only a short-term solution.
          </p>
          <h2>Our idea/solution</h2>
            We came with a cost-effective solution for the people who want a long term solution in their mobile repairs, what retech does is, we buy the mobile phones form the people who want to sell their mobile phones at a satisfying price based on the condition of the mobile phone and we dismantle it and collect the parts of the mobiles, and we will repair the mobile phone with original parts and we also give one year warranty to the part which got repaired. if we don't have the part which the customer wants we will ask the details of his mobile phone and we will place an advertisement on the mobile phone to buy it and we will notify
          the customer when the part which he wants to repair the same brand is available.
