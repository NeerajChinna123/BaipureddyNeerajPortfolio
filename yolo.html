          <h1>YOLO Object Detection</h1>
          <p>
Object detection is a technology that deals with computer vision and image processing that deals with detecting symmetric object detection algorithms typically basically done with machine learning or deep learning to produce a meaningful result.
	When we look at images or video we can just recognize as well as locate any object which surrounds us
	So, our goal for this project is to replicate this intelligence using a computer. Here for this project, we have used the YOLO object detection technique with open cv and NumPy.


          </p>

          <p>YOLO (you only look once) is a technique to do object detection it is more like an algorithm or strategy behind how the code is going to detect the object in an image which is being provided.so what YOLO does is that it look at the entire image only once and goes through the network only once and detects object hence itâ€™s very fast than other techniques. Now the basic question arises is that how does this yolo technique works, this work in the following steps.
            <ul>
             <li>YOLO first take the input image.</li>
             <li>The framework then divides the input image into grid lets assume that this object detection divides into grid of 3X3. </li>
             <li>Image classification and localization and applied on each grid. YOLO then predicts the bounding boxes and their corresponding classes probabilities for object. </li>
            </ul>
