          <h1>Represented Bennett in cricket</h1>
          <p>Cricket helped me to be physically fit and mentally strong and also created discipline in my life
	 and Since a sport requires obedience towards a goal, it enlisted hard work in me. And also sports teaches
	 you real-life lessons like how to face the pressure situations and also in a sport you will go through a difficult phase 
	 like injuries as I got a blood clot in my left hip when I slipped and fell down while bowling, it took me around 4 months 
	 to recover and after facing these difficult situations i learned that whenever you phase this you need to grow through it rather than going through
	 it.
          </p>

          <p>And our team coach Vikrant sir helped me to change my mindset and its a great privilege to represent the university because you are not playing for fun, you are carrying the responsibility. there are a lot of unforgettable memories with this great team, at last, you need to love the journey more than results.</p>
